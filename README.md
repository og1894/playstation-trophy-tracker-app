This web apps function is to display collections of PS3/4/5 games along with the trophy amount that each game has. All elements are 
linked from JSON files that respond to their stores and then to their controllers, which pass the contents on to the handlebars views
pages. The JSON and view code structure is straightforward and adaptive, allowing for the addition of new games, console generations and
authors at any time, and the code will display them correctly with the use of handlebars helpers. Further functionality might be added with 
assignments that require additional functions.
